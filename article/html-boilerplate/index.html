    <h1>La La Land</h1>
    <img src="img/la-la-land.webp">

    <p>La La Land is a 2016 American musical romantic comedy-drama film written and directed by Damien Chazelle. It
        stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as a struggling jazz pianist and an aspiring actress who meet and fall in love
        while pursuing their dreams in Los Angeles. The supporting cast includes John Legend, Rosemarie DeWitt, Finn
        Wittrock, and J. K. Simmons.</p>

    <p>Having been fond of musicals during his time as a drummer, Chazelle first conceptualized the film alongside
        Justin Hurwitz while attending Harvard University together. After moving to Los Angeles in 2010, Chazelle penned
        the script but did not find a studio willing to finance the production without changes to his design. After the
        success of his film Whiplash (2014), the project was picked up by Summit Entertainment. Miles Teller and Emma
        Watson were originally in talks to star, but after both dropped out, Gosling and Stone were cast. Filming took
        place in Los Angeles between August and September 2015, with the film's score composed by Hurwitz, who also
        wrote the film's songs with lyricists Benj Pasek and Justin Paul and the dance choreography by Mandy Moore.</p>

    <p>La La Land premiered at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival on August 31, 2016, and was released
        theatrically in the United States on December 9, by Lionsgate. The film emerged as a major commercial success,
        grossing $472 million worldwide on a budget of $30 million, and received widespread critical acclaim,
        particularly for Chazelle's direction and screenplay, the performances of Gosling and Stone, the score, musical
        numbers, cinematography, visual style, costumes and production design. It went on to receive numerous accolades,
        including winning a record seven awards at the 74th Golden Globe Awards and received eleven nominations at the
        70th British Academy Film Awards, winning five, including Best Film. The film also received a record-tying
        fourteen nominations at the 89th Academy Awards, winning in six categories including Best Director and Best
        Actress (Stone). In the former category, Chazelle became the youngest winner at age 32. It has since been
        regarded as one of the best films of the 2010s and the 21st century, and as one of the best musical and romantic
        films of all time.[a] A stage musical adaptation is in the works.[17]</p>

    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <img src="img/La.png">
    <p>While stuck in Los Angeles traffic, jazz pianist Sebastian "Seb" Wilder has a moment of road rage directed at
        aspiring actress Mia Dolan. After a hard day at work, Mia's next audition goes awry when the casting director
        takes a phone call during an emotional scene. That night, her roommates take her to a lavish party in the
        Hollywood Hills, promising her that someone in the crowd could jump-start her career. After her car is towed,
        she walks home in disappointment.

    <p>During a gig at a restaurant, Seb slips into jazz improvisation, despite the owner's warning to only play
        traditional Christmas pieces. Mia hears him playing as she passes by. Moved, she enters the restaurant and
        observes Seb being fired for disobedience. Mia attempts to compliment him as he storms out, but he brushes her
        off. Months later, she runs into Seb at a party where he plays in a 1980s pop cover band. After the gig, they
        walk to their cars and lament wasting a lovely night together despite their clear chemistry.</p>

    <p>Seb arrives at Mia's workplace, and she shows him around the Warner Bros. backlot, where she works as a barista,
        while expressing her passion for acting. He takes her to a jazz club, describing his passion for jazz and his
        desire to open his own club. Seb invites Mia to a screening of Rebel Without a Cause and she accepts, forgetting
        a date with her boyfriend. Bored with the latter date, she rushes to the theater and finds Seb as the film
        begins. When the screening is interrupted by a projector malfunction, Seb and Mia spend the rest of the evening
        together with a romantic visit to the Griffith Observatory.</p>

    <p>After more failed auditions, Mia decides, with Seb's encouragement, to write a one-woman play. He begins to
        perform regularly at a jazz club, and they eventually move in together. A former bandmate of Seb invites him to
        be the keyboardist in a new jazz fusion band, which will give him a steady income. Although dismayed by the
        band's pop style, Seb signs on after hearing Mia trying to convince her mother that he is working on his career.
        The band finds success, but Mia knows their music is not the type of music Seb wants to perform.</p>

    <p>During the band's first tour, Seb and Mia have an argument: she accuses him of abandoning his dreams, while he
        claims that she liked him more when he was unsuccessful because it made her feel better about herself. Two weeks
        later, Seb misses Mia's play because of a photoshoot he had forgotten about. The play does not go as
        successfully as either hoped; few people attend, and Mia overhears dismissive comments about her performance.
        Unable to forgive him for missing her play and their previous argument, Mia returns to her hometown of Boulder
        City, Nevada.</p>

    <p>Seb receives a phone call from a prominent casting director who attended Mia's play, inviting her to audition for
        an upcoming film. He drives to Boulder City and persuades her to attend, and she reluctantly agrees. During the
        audition, Mia is asked to simply tell a story. In response, she sings about how her aunt, a onetime stage
        actress who eventually died from alcoholism, inspired her to chase her dreams. Confident the audition was a
        success, Seb encourages Mia to devote herself to acting. The two then recognize that they will always love each
        other despite what may come for their relationship.
    </p>

    <p>Five years later, Mia is a famous actress and married to a different man, with whom she has a daughter. One
        night, the couple stumble upon a jazz bar. Recognizing the logo she had once designed, Mia realizes that Seb has
        opened his own jazz club. When he notices Mia in the crowd, Seb begins to play their love theme on the piano. A
        dream sequence unfolds in which the two imagine what might have been, had their relationship thrived along with
        their careers. Once the sequence ends, Seb and Mia acknowledge each other with a silent exchange of smiles
        before she leaves, and they go their separate ways.</p>
